        // 1. Rigidity : The software is difficult to change, even when the change is simple.
        // 2. Fragility : The software breaks in many places due to a single change.
        // 3. Immobility : The software is difficult to reuse because it cannot be disentangled from the current application.
        // 4. Opacity : The software is difficult to understand.
